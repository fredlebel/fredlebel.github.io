Premise
-------
I recently heard from someone interested in physics that the universe should be very simple at its base.  So simple in fact that one should be able to explain it to anyone off the street and that person would understand it.

My Position
-----------
While I would expect most physicists would agree that a theory of everything would be very simple and elegant, I disagree with the premise that it would be easy to understand.

Newtonian Brains
----------------
Our animal brains have evolved at a scale in the universe where objects are clumps of billions of atoms, the environment composed of solids, liquids and gases and where nothing moves very fast.  Our brains are excellent at visualizing and processing these concepts.  Our brains evolved in a Newtonian world and are expert at understanding it.  Our languages are from that same Newtonian world and are expert at describing it.

Non-Newtonian Physics
---------------------
The geometry of Special Relativity is just as simple as Newtonian geometry, almost identical in fact, but we have the hardest time visualizing and understanding it.  That's because while the two geometries are equivalently simple, we don't find the geometry of special relativity intuitive.  To make matters worse, our languages lack the facilities necessary for describing those unintuitive non-Newtonian concepts.  So we either rely on confusing analogies (space-time, particle wave duality, time dilation) which reuses familiar concepts, or we use the equally unintuitive but precise language of mathematics.

Today's Physics
---------------
As the theories of science stray further away from the common experiences at our human scale, general relativity at the large scale and quantum mechanics at the very small, we find them filled with increasingly unintuitive concepts.  That tends to leave the majority of the population out of the loop.  Making advances in the physics of the 21st century requires prolonged schooling, proficiency in complex mathematics and an ability to work with large international teams.  The days of the amateur physicist working alone and making great strides may be behind us.

Amateurs
--------
That's not to say that it would be a fruitless endeavour to attempt to study physics in one's free time.  On the contrary, today's science has gone so far, there's practically no limit to the amount of knowledge available to absorb.  So long as there's a willingness to work with unintuitive, abstract, mathematical or non-Newtonian concepts, the amateur physicist will be able to participate in the great discussions of our time.

Conclusion
----------
At its base the universe is likely very simple, but it would be a mistake to expect it to be intuitive and easily understandable to our Newtonian brains.
